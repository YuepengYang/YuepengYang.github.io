Hi, my name is Yuepeng Yang. I'm a first year PhD student at University of Chicago, Department of Statistics starting this Fall. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2020 with B.S. & M.S. degrees in mathematical sciences. Before that I spent 18 years in Shenzhen, a.k.a the city next to Hong Kong.

This site is a WIP.
