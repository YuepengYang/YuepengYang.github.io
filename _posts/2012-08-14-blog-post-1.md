<!-- I just constructed this website today and feel it's a good place to archive some thoughts of mine. In the past three month the topic that troubles me and almost everyone in the world is the coronavirus. It was a sudden transition in the September when we are told not to come back to the campus in the middle of the spring break. 

During the two month following the annoucement, I spent 99 percent of my life in a house near CMU. I do grocery and all purchases through online merchants and have literally no face to face contacts with anyone except my three housemates. While I was able to do so, I can imagine it would be hard for some other students who live in apartments or places with limited online grocery options. 

In mid-May I returned to China. The plan was that I should be able to get back to UChicago to begin my study as a PhD student in September if things go well. If not, I should be there by January next year. But the recent developments make me worry that I was being too optimistic. There're things that make me raise my eyebrows: the premature reopenning, lack of respect to lockdown rules, political fights over a public health issue, the soaring case numbers. I'm sure now that I won't go to Chicago in September and likely not going to make it by January either. 

Fall quarter, and maybe the whole 2020-2021 school year, will be challenging. The experience I had with online teacher/learning suggests that there will be a lot of problems. As a student, it is hard to stay focused and keep taking note in class. As a teaching assistant, it is (extermely) difficult to interact with the students or have instant feedbacks. There are no face cams, hand-raises, or slight nods/approvals. Being a first year student might make it even harder due to a lack of existing relationships with professors and students. -->
